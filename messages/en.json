    "paragraph1": "It all started over mint tea in Marrakech, in an alley only locals know. That day, we understood that the best travel moments aren't found in brochures. They're born from authentic encounters with those who truly live the territory.",
    "paragraph2": "The TRIPERS team travels first for you. We explore destinations, meet guides, test experiences. Then we become the architects of your journey: we find accommodations suited to your budget and desires, we draw coherent itineraries, we select activities that make sense. Nothing is standardized, everything is designed for you.",
    "paragraph3": "Our promise?",
    "paragraph3Content": "To introduce you only to guides we know personally. No anonymous platform, no cold algorithm. Just humans sharing their territory with authenticity and passion. You contact us on WhatsApp, we build together, and on D-day, your guide awaits you on site.",
    "card1Title": "Travel differently",
    "card1Content": "Favor the quality of encounters over the quantity of sites visited. Live experiences built for you, not standardized tours where 40 people follow the same program. Take time to understand a place through those who truly live there.",
    "card2Title": "Guarantee trust",
    "card2Content": "We only list guides we know personally. We've met them, tested them, validated them. Their integrity, their knowledge of the terrain, and their way of welcoming are our only criterion. No random profile found online.",
    "card3Title": "Support local economy",
    "card3Content": "Every euro spent directly benefits the guides and their communities. No anonymous intermediary capturing value, just a direct and fair link between you and the people showing you their territory."
