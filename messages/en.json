Sal is the perfect island to alternate relaxation, water sports, and discovery of a warm Cape Verdean culture.",

Riads hidden behind anonymous doors, surreal blue Majorelle gardens, terraces where you sip mint tea watching the Atlas in the distance. Beyond clichés, Marrakech is also a modern city: Gueliz and Hivernage neighborhoods, fusion restaurants, trendy rooftops.

Below, fresh water invites swimming. Along the path, you meet Barbary macaques living here freely. In the evening, the call to prayer resonates from Berber villages perched on the heights. It's a natural breath just hours from Marrakech.",

In the evening, you sleep in a bivouac under a sky saturated with stars, without light pollution. In the morning, you wake to desert silence. Between two dunes, you sometimes meet nomadic families still living here with their herds. Zagora is raw immensity, unfiltered, with no added backdrop.",
